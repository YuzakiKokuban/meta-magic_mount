## Magic Mount Metamodule

Implement systemless modification support for KSU.

The branch now uses a **C implementation**.

The previous **Rust implementation** is still available in a separate branch for reference:

Rust branch: `rust`

You can switch to the Rust version with:

```bash
git checkout rust
```
